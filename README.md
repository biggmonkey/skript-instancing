# skript-instancing
This is a library of functions that are when put together can be used to create a game instancing.

I made this project because I am broke myself and can't afford high end hardware or set up multiple servers for game instancing similar
to servers such as hypixel so this project is kind of how I think game instancing would work. 
This is only a framework afterall but I'll probably make an template of some sort because reading through
another person's codebase is just horrible and I don't wish it upon anyone.

I don't think there's a point to putting a license and crediting people when any skript made with skript can't really be **original**,
but please don't claim my work as yours.
